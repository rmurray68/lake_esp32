PROJECT MANIFEST: Lake House Internet Monitor & Controller
1. System Overview
A dual-layered monitoring and recovery system for a remote lake house.

Watchdog: XIAO ESP32-C3 monitoring local Wi-Fi/Fiber health.

Controller: Cellular-linked Logmor Smart Outlet for hard power cycling.

2. Hardware Identities
XIAO ESP32-C3:

Role: Pings Google every 60s, logs RSSI and status to AWS.

Signal Performance: ~ -34dBm (with external antenna).

Logmor Outlet (Particle-based):

Device ID: e00fce6876c70a0847482f67

Roles: A (Cable Modem), B (eero Wifi).

Power Policy: On Power Restore = ON.

3. Backend Infrastructure (AWS)
Database: DynamoDB Table LakeHouse_Logs (Stores uptime_sec, rssi, internet_ok).

Alerts: SNS (Simple Notification Service) triggered by internet failure.

Controller (Lambda): LakeHouse_Logmor_Controller (Python 3.12).

Functionality: 1. GET: Returns device health (Cell signal, Relay status, Temp). 2. POST (Action: Reboot): Triggers 30s hardware PowerCycle. 3. Safety-Net: Automatically forces relay ON if found in OFF state.

Secret Security: Authenticates via Environment Variable MY_SECRET.

4. API Access (Current)
Method: AWS Lambda Function URL.

Authentication: URL Parameter ?key=[MY_SECRET].

Actions: ?action=reboot or default check.

5. Goals for Phase 4 ✅ COMPLETED (January 2026)
Platform: AWS Amplify Gen 2 (Code-first infrastructure).

UI: Modern React web dashboard with Material-UI components.
  - Device Status Card: Shows online/offline, uptime, temperature, WiFi signal
  - Reboot Control: Button with confirmation dialog
  - Recent Activity: Table of health check logs
  - Responsive Design: Works on laptop and iPhone

Authentication: AWS Cognito (secure user management).

Backend: Serverless Lambda functions integrated with existing infrastructure.
  - getDeviceStatus: Queries DynamoDB for device status
  - triggerReboot: Invokes existing Logmor Lambda for power cycling
  
Integration: Designed to connect to existing AWS resources:
  - DynamoDB: LakeHouse_Logs table
  - Lambda: LakeHouse_Logmor_Controller
  - IoT Core: Real-time PubSub from ESP32
  - SNS: Email notifications on failures

Status: Frontend working with mock data, backend ready to deploy
Files: See QUICK_START.md, AMPLIFY_SETUP.md, INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md

6. New Web Dashboard Architecture (January 2026)
Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite + Material-UI
  Location: web-dashboard/
  Running at: http://localhost:5173 (development)
  Features: Authentication, responsive UI, real-time updates ready
  
Backend: AWS Amplify Gen 2
  Location: amplify/
  Resources: Auth (Cognito), Lambda functions, IAM permissions
  Deployment: Sandbox (development) or Amplify Console (production)

Deployment Options:
  1. Local Sandbox: npx ampx sandbox (requires Node.js 22)
  2. Amplify Console: Push to GitHub, auto-deploys

Documentation:
  - QUICK_START.md: Get started guide
  - AMPLIFY_SETUP.md: Detailed setup instructions  
  - INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md: Connect to existing AWS resources
  - DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md: Production deployment steps
  - PROJECT_SUMMARY.md: Complete project overview

Next Steps: Deploy backend and connect to real DynamoDB/Lambda

How to move to VS Code & Amplify ✅ DONE
